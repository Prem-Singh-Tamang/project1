					<h2>what is De-suup?</h2>
					<h3>posted 22-10-2022</h3>   
					<p>Shrouded in orange, they serve tirelessly, like guardians watching over Bhutan. 

They are graduates of the Desuung programme.

"De" originates from "Dekyid" which means peace. "Suung" refers to guarding. Therefore, Desuung means "Guardians of Peace". 

Launched on February 14, 2011 by the fifth King of Bhutan, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, the De-suung programme aims to encourage citizens to take up a role in nation-building. The training aspires to develop among the participants a sense of community and foster teamwork. Most importantly, it instils in them a spirit of "volunteerism".

Any citizen who has undergone this training is encouraged to assist during disaster relief, participate in charitable activities, and be of service to those around them. 

The volunteers are called Desuups. </p>

					<h2>The De-suung Logo</h2>   
					<h3>Posted October 17th, 2022</h3>
					<p>The Desuung logo was designed based on Bhutanese motif. The Dorji (thunderbolt) represents fearlessness and indestructibility. The main shaft denotes the Monarchy, which symbolises national unity, strength and harmony. Meanwhile, the raven depicts the Monarchy who is the Supreme Commander and Chief of the armed forces. Also, the Norbu (jewels) refers to wisdom.

The Desuung's connection to society is portrayed by wings in five colours â€” symbolising the lay, spiritual, executive, judiciary, and the legislature.</p>

                    <h3>posted 22-10-2022</h3>
					<p>On 30th June 2021, the Desuups were mobilised to aid the police following an unfortunate landslide near Torobari. The landslide claimed two lives. This is just one example of the kind of disaster response the De-suups are involved in. They were also there to help when the historic Wangdue Dzong caught fire.</p>
